I am a third-year Computer Science student at King's College London with a passion for cybersecurity, focusing on governance, risk, and compliance (GRC). I enjoy applying my skills in real-world scenarios, whether through setting up a comprehensive cybersecurity home lab, conducting vulnerability assessments, or participating in CTF competitions.

## Objective

I am always eager to learn and grow, driven by a desire to make digital spaces safer and help others develop their security knowledge. I'm currently looking for graduate roles in security engineering and consultancy to further expand my expertise and make a meaningful impact in the field.
